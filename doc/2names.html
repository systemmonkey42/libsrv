<H2>Accessing another name</H2>

<P>With <CODE>SRV</CODE> records, a service under your domain name is translated to a server name.
Translating the latter name to an IP number is another step to take.
This means that a networking client receives two names under which to try contacting a host.</P>

<P>Some protocols send the name under which a server is addressed to the server, so that it may host multiple domains; this is called <EM>virtual hosting</EM>, and it is common practice for web and email.
Having two names to address a virtual host under only provides more options, namely to first try to use one name, and if that fails, to try the other.
It seems sensible to test the most specific name, first; that would be the name of your (sub)domain.</P>

<P>One application of this approach is to make use of virtual hosting solutions that offer you a free subdomain but that do not support hosting your domain directly.
For such services, the first attempt to address them under your domain name would fail, but addressing them under their subdomain (the server name in the SRV record) would succeed.
For example, this would be possible for web hosting, and perhaps even for email hosting.</P>

<P>This scenario is supported in our <A HREF="http://dns.vanrein.org/srv/lib">SRV library</A> by returning the name of the server contacted to the networking client.</P>

<P><B>Example.</B>
The <A HREF="http://www.tpc.int">TPC fax service</A> is a wonderful instrument, offering fax delivery over the Internet (as email or through hylafax) and local volunteers that actually send out faxes.
Their system is based on domain names, where <CODE>8.6.0.1.4.7.8.0.2.1.3.tpc.int</CODE> is their name for my fax number <CODE>+31 20 8741068</CODE>.
I could setup a fax service under my domain, pointing to their name, as follows:
<PRE>
_smtp._tpc  IN SRV  0 0 25 8.6.0.1.4.7.8.0.2.1.3.tpc.int.
</PRE>
Unlike <CODE>MX</CODE> records which are not interpreted this way, it is possible to interpret this second name as a possible domain for the email, after my own domain name gets rejected (which it will).</P>
