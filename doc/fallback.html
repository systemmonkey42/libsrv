<H2>Fallback servers with SRV records</H2>

<P>One advantage of <CODE>SRV</CODE> records is that they enable fallback servers for your domain.
This scheme is well-known from <CODE>MX</CODE> (mail exchange) records, which indicate a cost (afka priority) for each server, and require clients to try to contact the lowest-cost server first:
<PRE>
@           IN MX   10       my.first.mail.server.
            IN MX   10       my.second.mail.server.
            IN MX   90       some.fallback.server.
</PRE>
This setup defines two mail exchanging host with the same priority for your domain, and allows fallback to a third server in case both your lower-cost servers fail.
Normally, the load is evenly balanced between the two low-cost servers, and the fallback server would not be addressed at all.</P>

<P>Most people will agree that email is a rock-solid protocol, and trust their email to have arrived if it did not bounce.
This certainly applies with the use of mature, Un*x-only email solutions.
Most people will also agree that the world wide web is not nearly as reliable as email.
Of course, email is simpler because it can be deferred for later retries, but the ability to express these fallback servers certainly helps a lot.</P>

<P>With <CODE>SRV</CODE> records, it is possible to define fallback servers for <EM>any</EM> service, for example:
<PRE>
; Mail servers (with fallback support)
_smtp._tcp  IN SRV  10 0 25  my.first.mail.server.
            IN SRV  10 0 25  my.second.mail.server.
            IN SRV  90 0 25  some.fallback.server.

; Web servers (with fallback support)
_http._tcp  IN SRV  10 0 80  web.host.near.backbone.
            IN SRV  90 0 80  my.slow.computer.at.home.
</PRE>
Can we agree that this fallback scheme would be an improvement, at least for the web servers who have no other way to support this?
Imagine a world wide web with no downtime for domain's web services, that would be <EM>quote</EM> a change!</P>

<P>Please note, it <EM>is</EM> possible to define multiple computers for the same domain, but most networking clients only consider the first one they get.
The order of multiple computers is given out in random order by the DNS server, implying even load balancing.
Although this may be desirable in some cases, it certainly is not the intention when connection speeds differ strongly, as in the situation suggested above.</P>
