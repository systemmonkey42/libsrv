<H2>Virtual hosting improved</H2>

<P>Virtual hosting is the technique of supporting multiple (sub)domains on a single computer.
This is beneficial because it makes it profitable to have specialised server providers which are close to the Internet backbones.</P>

<P>Virtual hosting works for protocols that inform the server of the domain name being used to address it.
These names are usually aliased to the `official' name of the server with a <CODE>CNAME</CODE> tag, or to its IP number with an <CODE>A</CODE> tag.
The disadvantage of this approach is that such redirection of your name forces you to host <EM>all</EM> the business for that domain at the virtual host.
This has the disadvantage that only protocols that inform the server of your domain name can be really hosted.
Ever wondered why all virtual hosting providers help you to <CODE>mail</CODE> and <CODE>web</CODE>, and none helps you to <CODE>ftp</CODE>? Here's your answer.</P>

<P>With <CODE>SRV</CODE> records, you specify redirection <EM>per service</EM> and not for a whole computer number.
In effect, these records embed knowledge about services into the DNS system; hence their name.
Unlike older systems with pre-defined ports per service, or requiring a remote lookup for a predefined program number, the <CODE>SRV</CODE> records are so kind to mention the port at the host.
Do realise, that a virtual hosting provider can opt to offer you your private FTP space on a certain port of their servers; the incoming port number would make it possible to distinguish between multiple clients that they host.

<P>Some virtual hosting providers offer only a subname to their own domain; this is more pleasant regarding responsibility issues related to the ownership of an IP number.
The <CODE>SRV</CODE> records have the advantage of clearly separating the alias from its serving IP number.</P>
