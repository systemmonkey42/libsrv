<H2>Load balancing</H2>

<P>Large companies make efforts to offer load balanced service for their bussiest servers, mostly the web servers.
Although such schemes are <EM>possible</EM> with the older DNS records, it certainly is somewhat clumsy.
Let's consider a few schemes.</P>

<P><B>Multiple IPs.</B>
One name can have multiple IP numbers in the DNS.
A DNS server will produce these numbers in random order, and most networking clients pick the first one to access the server.
Although this works nicely, it provides no fallback scheme in the case of a server dropout.
True, client code could try the next server if one fails, but that scheme is usually not implemented in networking clients.
Moreover, the DNS gives names out in a cycle, meaning that the breakdown of one server would mean a double load on the second.
We have built a <A HREF="http://dns.vanrein.org/srv/lib">SRV library</A> that will try all IP numbers until a server accepts a connection, but this still addresses the IP numbers in the DNS-prescribed cycle.</P>

<P><B>One IP, multipe servers.</B>
It is possible to define only a single IP number in the DNS, and set up multiple servers that externally claim the same IP number but have some way of internal communication to ensure they agree.
The problem with this approach is that IP numbers are used for routing, and thus all servers are available through the same route.
If that route goes down, it takes several minutes before routers have adapted to an alternative route to the Internet... if it exists at all!</P>

<P><B>One IP at multiple places.</B>
I am not sure if this scheme would work at all, but imagine placing servers with the same IP number accross the world.
The DNS would mention this single IP number, and routers pass on different routes to that IP number.
The Routing Interface Protocol is designed to remember only the shortest route to an IP number, so the result would be that all routers direct traffic to the nearest-by server.
However, as with the previous solution, if one server goes down, it takes several minutes for the routers to adapt, which is not always acceptable.</P>

<P><B>Enter SRV records.</B>
Every <CODE>SRV</CODE> record specifies a relative weight, to be used in load balancing schemes.
When the <CODE>SRV</CODE> records are sorted on cost (afka priority), they can also be sorted based on this weight factor.
The idea (as I understood it --- <A HREF="http://dns.vanrein.org/srv/srv-promotion/rfc2782.txt">RFC 2782</A> is not clear about it) is to divide traffic in the ratio specified in the weights, for example:
<PRE>
_http._tcp  IN SRV  0 10 80  a.web.host.
            IN SRV  0 29 80  b.web.host.
            IN SRV  0 33 80  c.web.host.
</PRE>
in this scenario, the r2tio for dividing traffic between hosts <CODE>a:b:c</CODE> should be approximately to the ratio <CODE>10:29:33</CODE>.</P>
<P>To divide traffic, we cannot trust the DNS servers, which order the <CODE>SRV</CODE> records cyclically and fairly; the ratio gives an unfareness not implemented in what the DNS server sends out.
So the networking client must take care of this; preferrably in some dedicated <A HREF="http://dns.vanrein.org/srv/lib">SRV library</A>.</P>
<P>One way to achieve the ratio is to pick a random selection between the servers, weighed according to the weights.
But a smarter technique is also possibe, where the random number generation is replaced by nearness calculations for each of the hosts.
<EM>It may be possible to derive such nearness information, in the form of the number of hops to a destination, based on the Router Interface Protocol, but this is currently work to be done for our SRV library.</EM></P>
